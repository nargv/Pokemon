**Pok√©mon search engine**

This is a small, light-weight, interactive & highly-responsive pokemon search engine.

Enter a pokemon name and press search button or enter key to create the request. This will fetch a small sprite and a shakespeare translated description of the pokemon. These descriptions are a random pick of a list of available descriptions for any individual pokemon. If the pokemon doesn't exist or the entry is an invalid input, the UI will make sure to let you know.

All your searches are saved per session using redux tools. It stores a pokemon's name, description and the sprite. In the second tab of "History", you'll be able to view all the searches you've made in the session.
